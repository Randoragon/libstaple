.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR sp_queue_eq ()
function intakes two queues and compares their contents. The
queues are considered equal if and only if all of the following
conditions are met:
.IP (1)
.IR queue1->elem_size " == " queue2->elem_size
.IP (2)
.IR queue1->size " == " queue2->size
.IP (3)
The queues' contents are equivalent, i.e. they both comprise of equal elements
in the same order.
.P
.IR queue1 " and " queue2
are the queues to compare. The order of these arguments does not matter.
.P
.I cmp
is a pointer to a comparator function that shall be invoked on
every pair of consecutive elements from
.IR queue1 " and " queue2
to decide whether they are equal or not. The function must be implemented in
such a way that the first argument is the address to
.IR queue1 's
nth element and the second argument is the address to
.IR queue2 's
nth element.
The function must return 0 if elements are different and non-0 if they are
equal.
.P
.B NULL
may be passed as \fIcmp\fP instead, in which case elements are compared using
.BR memcmp (3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR sp_queue_eq ()
function shall return \fB1\fP if the comparison was successful and
.IR queue1 " and " queue2
are equal. Otherwise, it shall return
.BR 0 .
.SH ERRORS
.\". MAN_SHALL_FAIL_IF sp_queue_eq
.\". MAN_ERRCODE 0
Either
.IR queue1 " or " queue2
is a null pointer (debug mode only).
