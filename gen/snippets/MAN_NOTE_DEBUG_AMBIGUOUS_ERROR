In debug mode, functions of the suffixed form (except
.BR $1$ ())
do not provide an unambiguous error-detecting interface with return codes.
Returning 0 should be considered more so a fallback mechanism, since it doesn't
imply that an error has occurred.
.P
This means there is a guaranteed runtime uncertainty whenever one of these
functions in debug mode returns 0. However, the functions shall still print
error messages when appropriate, so failures can be told apart from successes by
the presence or absence of those (quiet mode needs to be disabled).
.P
At first, this ambiguity might seem strange and unacceptable. However, it is
justified in two ways:
.IP (1)
It is very convenient to have these functions return the value of the element
directly.
.sp -1
.IP (2)
The only errors that can occur are such resulting from library misuse by the
end-user, and not caused by uncontrollable factors such as insufficient memory,
etc. Program logic itself should guarantee safety from these errors.
