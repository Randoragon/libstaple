The
.BR sp_$1$_get ()
function has another, very important use case. It pairs up well with all kinds
of functions which intake a pointer to write something into it, e.g.
.BR scanf (3).
In those cases, it may be faster to pass the direct location, rather than
using a proxy variable/buffer. For example, code like:
.sp
.ad l
.nf
	int val;
	scanf("%d", &val);
	sp_$1$_seti($1$, idx, val);
.sp
.ad
.fi
can be simplified to:
.sp
.ad l
.nf
	scanf("%d", (int*)sp_$1$_get($1$, idx));
.ad
.fi
